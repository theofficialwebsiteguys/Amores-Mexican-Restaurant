        <p class="review-text">Parents â€” Amores is a great option for bringing your kids out in town. Itâ€™s big enough that you shouldnâ€™t have to stress about a long wait for a table; they have a great kids menu (with French fries if your kids are picky); and adults can enjoy their excellent food and margaritas. Their menu is much better and sophisticated than the typical suburban Mexican restaurant. Definitely better than the options in Salem, last I checked. The service was great too: prompt, friendly, accommodating.</p>

        <p class="review-text">SUCH a wonderful place!! This is the best Mexican food weâ€™ve had since moving to New England. We had taquitos and chimichangas and both were delicious, but the highlight for me was the flan. OMG it was so creamy! And the staff were so kind and welcoming. We will definitely be back!</p>

        <p class="review-text">Coming from south Texas, we were afraid we wouldnâ€™t be able to find anything close to the taquerias we were used to. Amores really filled the void!!! Fresh chips, good salsa, and a really unique & delish bean dip come out first. The chimichangas were â€¦. sooooo goood. ðŸ”¥ queso, ðŸ”¥ mole, ðŸ”¥ margs.</p>
